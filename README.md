# Song Recommender ML

This is a ML project implemented using Python, where it recommends you songs based on three criteria, namely : 
- Popularity based Recommendation
- Collaborative based Recommendation
- Content based Recommendation

## How to start?

Before you start, make sure you convert the given two `.RAR` files to `.CSV` using [EzyZip](https://www.ezyzip.com/convert-rar-to-csv.html)

- Add the `Song-Recommender.ipynb`, `song_data.csv`, and `triplets_file.csv` to your [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/drive/)
- Run `Song-Recommender.ipynb` in your [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Suggestions

- Since the dataset is gargantuan(about 2 million), it is advisable to limit the data to the first 10K columns for quick results.
- If you're patient enough, you can run the code as it is(with 2 million datasets) and wait for 15 minutes for your results.
